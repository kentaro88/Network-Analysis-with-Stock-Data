# Network-Analysis-with-Stock-Data

## Goal 
To understand how bootstrap ,which is one of statistical methods, works and how to create a graph on R.

I picked stock data from each GICS(Global Industry Classification Standard) sector. Correlation coefficient between all stocks is computed by the transition of stock price during the fixed time. I made a network graph regarding the correlation coefficient and checked that the stocks in the same GICS sectors are clustered together.
